## [1.0.4] - 2021-05-26
- [JS Files](https://maven.revealbi.io/repository/public/com/infragistics/reveal/sdk/reveal-sdk-distribution/1.0.4/reveal-sdk-distribution-1.0.4-js.zip)
- Added thumbnail (preview icon) JS component, more information in the new React sample: [upmedia-browser](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-react/blob/main/upmedia-browser/README.md) and in [sdk-samples-java](https://github.com/RevealBi/sdk-samples-java/blob/develop/README.md#returning-the-list-of-dashboards).
- Added a new setting to include session cookies in requests to Reveal backend (which causes the "withCredentials" flag in jQuery.ajax to be turned on):
```javascript
$.ig.RevealSdkSettings.requestWithCredentialsFlag = true;
```
- Improved the "save" event to inform if the action is "saveAs" or a new dashboard is being saved, also allows to set the assigned name and dashboard id. Here sample code that handles the save event and asks for a new name when the dashboard is new or the action is "save as":
```javascript
view.onSave = function(rv, saveEvent) {
  if (saveEvent.saveAs || saveEvent.isNew) {
    var name = prompt("Dashboard name: ", saveEvent.name);
    if (name != null) {
      saveEvent.name = name;
      saveEvent.dashboardId = RevealApi.RevealUtility.generateUID();
    } else {
      return;
    }
  }
  saveEvent.saveFinished();
};
```
- Bug fixes:
  - The first chart in the dashboard will be exported even if you select another chart.
  - Data Stores get displayed automatically in the data source navigator even when they haven't been passed through DataSourcesRequestedCallback.
  - Fixed issue with MS SQL Server connections using instance name instead of port number.
  - Fixed list of date formats available for DateTime data type.
  - Added two new date formats for Date, DateTime and Day level aggregations including day of the week in short format.

- Added Snowflake connector, including support for data blending between tables in the same Snowflake database.
- The Reveal BI Engine now supports the same limits supported in other platforms.
  - This is to avoid the server to crash if a user creates a visualization that requires too much data to be sent back to the client.
